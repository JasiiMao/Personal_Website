<h2>About my Work</h2>
	<p>I created many of these pieces in High School. I do intend at some point to update the portfolio pieces with more recent work, though I have been very busy with school work these days. I wanted to talk about the pieces I've done by section briefly. </p>
<p>The first section I wanted to showcase was my original illustrations work, every single piece has been drawn and sketched by hand. If you're a fan of Genshin you'll see that most of my inspiration stems from the game ! I started playing Genshin around 2020 when quarantine hit and it was a huge comfort game for me and I was especially inspired by all the beautiful designs that the game had offered. I also drew some other characters mostly from friend's original characters or some other designs that inspired me outside of Genshin. </p>
	<p>Next I wanted to showcase my graphic design work since I am interested in the field as a career. In my graphic design portfolio I have a mix of photos and illustrations combined. For the most part I had edited and combined photos I found online together with hand drawn elements. Through these works I had also become proficient in using Adobe products. Most of these graphics were inspired by poster designs.</p>
	<p>For simple illustrations, these art pieces were supposed to be used for any merchandise use or for simple logo work. In contrast to illustrations, I wanted these pieces to be as simple as possible since I found that a more minimal design meant that information wasn't as easily lost when scaled down. I think that these principles are especially important for logos when the business or individual wants to be able to print and display them across a variety of product sizes.</p>
	<p>Lastly, I included art studies that I've done since it shows my growth and understanding of elements drawn from real life. This was also inspired by a portfolio review I had done in high school. The reviewer had pointed out that in order to garner the best outcome for drawing that I should do more still life studies. As a result, I did a lot of studies featuring a mix of my own photos and photos I had found on pinterest.</p>
