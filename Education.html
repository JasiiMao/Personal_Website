	<h2>High School Education</h2>
	<img src = "Sandia_High_School_courtyard,_Albuquerque_NM.jpg" alt = "Sandia High School Commons" width = "50%" class = "center"/>
	<p>I graduated from Sandia High School as Valedictorian in spring of 2023. During my time at Sandia, I had taken several AP classes starting my sophomore year. I also participated in various clubs such as Ceramics club, Art club, Gardening Club, and STEM Club. Most of these clubs I had joined in my senior year, but I have been part of the STEM Club since my junior year of high school. I also participated in the Governor's STEM Challenge through the STEM Club and worked as the designer for the team. At the challenge we were able to be sponsored by a company the two years we had participated.  </p>
	<h2>College Education</h2>
	<p>I am nearing the end of my first semester at the University of Newe Mexico. Currently I am working towards a BA in Architecture with a concentration in Design Studies. I am also planning to do a minor in Game Design or Computer Science. I have also joined an organization called the Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers. Currently, I am an associate member studying under our vice president. Though, I am mostly tasked with managing the social media and making the graphics for our instagram page.</p>
